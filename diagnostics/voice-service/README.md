# MechPro Voice Intake Service

Converts inbound-call transcripts into structured work orders that import
directly into the MechPro dispatch board.

**Source:** ported from [`tinytim3271-wq/Reliable-Voice-`](https://github.com/tinytim3271-wq/Reliable-Voice-)  
**Dependencies:** Python 3.9+ standard library only — no `pip install` required.

## Integration with MechPro app

The JSON schema returned by `/intake-call` mirrors the work-order structure
used by `app.js` (see the `aiPhoneForm` and `aiWorkflowForm` functions). To
import a voice-generated work order into the running app, POST the response
body to your configured backend or use the **AI Phone** tool in the
Workbench panel to paste the transcript directly.

## Running tests

```bash
python3 diagnostics/voice-service/tests/test_voice_service.py
# optional if you already use pytest:
python3 -m pytest diagnostics/voice-service/tests/ -v
```
